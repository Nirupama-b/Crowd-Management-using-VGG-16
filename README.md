# Crowd-Management-using-VGG-16
This project implements a real-time crowd counting system using the VGG-19 deep learning model. It analyzes live CCTV footage to estimate the number of people in each frame and can be used for crowd control and safety management in high-density areas like railway stations.

✨ Features

Uses VGG-19 for people counting through density map estimation

Real-time video frame processing with OpenCV

Accurate estimation of crowd size per frame

Can be integrated with alert systems to prevent overcrowding

Designed for deployment in railway stations and other public areas

🚀 Achievements

Selected for the Internal Qualification Round of the Smart India Hackathon

Optimized for real-time inference
